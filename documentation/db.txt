Database source: docker image fuzzylombax/5e-srd-database
This database belonged to an open source 5e rest api project, but was very outdated in terms of 5th edition content. 
Mongodump + mongorestore exported it to my own mongo atlas cluster.
Will need to update with newer data, the current plan is to write a scraper that will go through dnd 5e wiki sites.
So far I've decided to continue using the schema, but will probably need to audit and refactor it in some way soon. I don't think it's affected my domain type designs.
